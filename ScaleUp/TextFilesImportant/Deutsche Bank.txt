 SQL-
 ===
 Certainly! Here's the basic syntax of SQL (Structured Query Language):

1. SELECT statement:
   - Retrieve data from one or more tables.
   - Syntax: `SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;`

2. INSERT statement:
   - Insert data into a table.
   - Syntax: `INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);`

3. UPDATE statement:
   - Modify existing data in a table.
   - Syntax: `UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;`

4. DELETE statement:
   - Remove data from a table.
   - Syntax: `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`

5. CREATE statement:
   - Create a new table, view, or other database objects.
   - Syntax: `CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype, column2 datatype, ...);`

6. ALTER statement:
   - Modify the structure of an existing table (add, modify, or drop columns).
   - Syntax: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype;`

7. DROP statement:
   - Delete an existing table or other database objects.
   - Syntax: `DROP TABLE table_name;`

8. SELECT DISTINCT statement:
   - Retrieve unique values from a column.
   - Syntax: `SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;`

9. WHERE clause:
   - Filter rows based on a specific condition.
   - Syntax: `SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;`

10. ORDER BY clause:
    - Sort the result set in ascending or descending order.
    - Syntax: `SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;`

These are some of the basic SQL syntax elements. SQL is a rich and versatile language with many more advanced features and statements available.
